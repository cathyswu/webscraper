Towards this goal, a top priority for the USGS is to provide information to better define and manage the quality of the Nation's water resources. The CACL directly addresses this priority issue for the USGS by improving strategies to identify and protect drinking-water sources. The approach of the CACL is focused on the integration of the various disciplines that include core examination, sequence stratigraphy, borehole geophysics, digital optical borehole imaging, seismic, ground-penetrating radar, and 3D geomodeling.\nThe mission of the Carbonate Aquifer Characterization Laboratory (CACL) is to develop methods for carbonate aquifer characterization and conduct applied research that focuses on better understanding groundwater flow in multi-porosity carbonate aquifers. Groundwater flow in carbonate aquifers is particularly difficult to characterize because of a broad range in pore size and complicated pore connectivity. Diverse porosity and permeability networks represent a significant challenge to the accurate simulation of carbonate aquifer groundwater flow. This research is integrating the use of state-of-the-art technologies, including:\nThe capabilities of the Carbonate Aquifer Characterization Laboratory (CACL) are diverse and have largely concentrated on (1) hydrogeologic framework studies, (2) aquifer characterization, and (3) freshwater-saltwater interface delineation.

Hazardous volcanic... \nWhen erupting, all volcanoes pose a degree of risk to people and infrastructure, however, the risks are not equivalent from one volcano to another because of differences in eruptive style and geographic location. Assessing the relative threats posed by U.S. volcanoes identifies which volcanoes warrant the greatest risk-mitigation efforts by the U.S. Geological Survey and its partners... \nWhat do you do when a sleeping volcano roars back to life? For more than three decades, countries around the world have called upon the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) to contribute expertise and equipment in times of crisis. Co-funded by the USGS and the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance... \nAt least 170 volcanoes in 12 States and 2 territories have erupted in the past 12,000 years and have the potential to erupt again. Consequences of eruptions from U.S. volcanoes can extend far beyond the volcano’s immediate area. Many aspects of our daily life are vulnerable to volcano hazards, including air travel, regional power generation and transmission infrastructure, interstate... \nVolcanic eruptions happen in the State of California about as frequently as the largest earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault Zone. At least 10 eruptions have taken place in California in the past 1,000 years—most recently at Lassen Peak in Lassen Volcanic National Park (1914 to 1917) in the northern part of the State—and future volcanic eruptions are inevitable. The U.S. Geological... \nViewing an erupting volcano is a memorable experience, one that has inspired fear, superstition, worship, curiosity, and fascination since before the dawn of civilization. In modern times, volcanic phenomena have attracted intense scientific interest because they provide the key to understanding processes that have created and shaped more than 80 percent of the Earth’s surface. The... \nEruption of Yellowstone's Old Faithful Geyser. Yellowstone hosts the world's largest and most diverse collection of natural thermal features, which are the surface expression of magmatic heat at shallow depths in the crust. The Yellowstone system is monitored by the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership among the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Yellowstone National Park... \nVolcanoes have been erupting in the Cascade Range for over 500,000 years. During the past 4,000 years eruptions have occurred at an average rate of about 2 per century. This chart shows 13 volcanoes on a map of Washington, Oregon, and northern California and time lines for each showing the ages of their eruptions. \nThe Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest has more than a dozen potentially active volcanoes. Cascade volcanoes tend to erupt explosively, and on average two eruptions occur per century—the most recent were at Mount St. Helens, Washington (1980–86 and 2004–8), and Lassen Peak, California (1914–17). To help protect the Pacific Northwest’s rapidly expanding population, USGS scientists at... \nIn the early 1960s, the emergence of the theory of plate tectonics started a revolution in the earth sciences. Since then, scientists have verified and refined this theory, and now have a much better understanding of how our planet has been shaped by plate-tectonic processes. We now know that, directly or indirectly, plate tectonics influences nearly all geologic processes, past and... \n  *[*]: required\n",

The system resides at the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California. It requires the operator to take specialized training and hold safety certifications.\nThe Geotek RXCT, a \"rotating x-ray computed tomography\" system, creates ultra high-resolution imagery of sediment cores. The system resides at the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California. It requires the operator to take specialized training and hold X-ray radiation and safety certifications.\nIn medicine, radiologists use computed tomography (CT) scans to collect highly detailed images of your body. Similarly, the RXCT creates a complete 3-D image rendering of a sediment core by combining a series of X-ray images taken from different angles around it (thus, the \"rotating\" part of the name). The system then uses computer processing to create cross-sectional images (slices) of the core. Thus, a CT scan provides more detailed information than a simple 2-D X-ray image.\nThe images created by the RXCT allow scientists to look into the core at any area and at any angle, without having to carve into it. Looking at the structure and composition of cores in this fashion helps scientists determine the history of the location where the core was collected, such as the seafloor, a lake bed, or a marshy area. For example, if they find a sandy layer in an otherwise calm environment, like a coastal marsh which is normally just peat and mud, this may be evidence of a big wave event that carried sand from the beach and nearshore back into the marsh area. Further inspection of the CT image may reveal subtle sedimentary characteristics of the sandy deposit such as changes in grainsize, heavy mineral layers, and rip-up clasts that may help researchers determine whether deposition occurred during a tsunami or a storm.\nImages from a sediment core taken from Floras Lake, a coastal lake in southern Oregon. At the far left is a false color computed tomography (CT) scan of a sediment core, and next to it is an actual photograph of the core. The box shows the area of an expanded, zoomed-in section of these images, which is displayed in the center. In both the CT scan and the photograph, the lighter, brighter colors are dense sand and the darker colors are mud layers. At far right is another false color image of the CT scan. Scientists use the CT scan in order to see unique aspects of the layers of sediment that may otherwise not be visible.\nFalse color CT scan of a core from Floras Lake, a coastal lake in southern Oregon that contains a record of tsunamis going back at least 6700 years. The beige (light) color is sand, which is more dense than the mud (brown, dark) surrounding it. As the animation continues, the darker colors are hidden in order to highlight the lighter colors of the sand deposits. This helps scientists see amazing detail to help them form the sedimentologic \"story\" about how the sand was deposited. The oval fragments of mud in the upper part of the sandy deposit appear to be rip-up clasts, indicative of an erosive, high flow into the lake that deposited beach and dune sand in the basin. This particular deposit is about 8 cm thick, and radiocarbon dating of sediments above and below the sand suggest that the tsunami was generated by a Cascadia megathrust earthquake roughly 2000 years ago.\nThe figure shows the location of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives conducted in September 2020, plus three images of the CT scan data from one of the collected cores. The ROV is operated by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) from the research vessel (R/V) . The USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz regularly collaborates with MBARI, and most recently the USGS and MBARI efforts center around the study of the Cascadian Margin, a subduction zone off CA, OR, and WA. The figure includes a photograph of a vertical slice through the upper 80 cm of the core \"DR1281 VC-870,\" with a zoomed in section to the right, outlined in red. Lighter colors indicate sandy sediment and suggest horizons associated with 4 turbidites. In the lower right is a perpendicular slice through a horizon (its location is marked as an orange line through the zoomed-in cross-section) showing coarse grains that are characteristic of turbidites. Previously published work identified a sand layer in a core at this same site and subbottom depth, which was determined to be associated with the January 1700 Cascadia mega-earthquake and subsequent tsunami.\n####  [ Rebounds, regresses, and recovery: A 15-year study of the coral reef community at Pila‘a, Kaua‘i after decades of natural and anthropogenic stress events ](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/rebounds-regresses-and-recovery-a-15-year-study-coral-reef-community-pilaa-kauai-after)\nPila‘a reef on the north shore of Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i was subjected to a major flood event in 2001 that deposited extensive sediment on the reef flat, resulting in high coral mortality.

The PCCTs consist of a manipulator to move pressure core sediments between storage chambers and specialized cells; a customized saw to cut off lengths of sediment core while maintaining them at high pressures; and a suite of pressure cells that can be used to measure the strength, compressibility, permeability, and other characteristics of hydrate-bearing sediments. Constraining the properties of pressure cores provides information about whether sediments will collapse during drilling, how much methane can be extracted from the gas hydrate, and which processes are necessary to sustain gas hydrate dissociation in a production well. \nIn recent years, USGS researchers have designed and built additional tools and pressure cells to manipulate and interrogate pressure cores. For example, researchers have redesigned parts of the PCCTs to accommodate wider-diameter pressure cores. A new cell with a sapphire window allows researchers to see the sediment sample as it moves through the manipulator. A high-stress triaxial permeameter cell constructed in 2021 will permit measurement of both permeability and relative permeability of hydrate-bearing sediments once fully tested. \nIn addition to analyzing pressure cores, the USGS Gas Hydrates Project also contributes expertise in transport and storage of these special samples.
