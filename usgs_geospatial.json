It replaced the former Long Valley Observatory (LVO), which was established in 1982 to monitor the restless Long Valley Caldera and Mono-Inyo Craters region of Eastern California. CalVO now monitors these and other potentially hazardous volcanoes in California and Nevada to help communities and government authorities understand, prepare for, and respond to, volcanic activity. \nSixteen young volcanoes designated as Low Threat to Very High Threat are dispersed throughout the State. Partially molten rock (magma) resides beneath at least seven of these—Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, Lassen Volcanic Center, Clear Lake Volcanic Field, the Long Valley Volcanic Region, Coso Volcanic Field, and Salton Buttes— producing volcanic earthquakes(seismicity), toxic gas emissions, hot springs, and (or) ground movement (deformation).\n[ In Memoriam: Wes Hildreth, 1938-2025 ](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/calvo/news/memoriam-wes-hildreth-1938-2025)\nJuly 8, 2025\n####  In Memoriam: Wes Hildreth, 1938-2025 \n[ Research and outreach in the Clear Lake Volcanic Field ](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/calvo/news/research-and-outreach-clear-lake-volcanic-field)\nJuly 1, 2025\n####  Research and outreach in the Clear Lake Volcanic Field \n[ Taking the mystery out of volcanic gas sampling ](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/calvo/news/taking-mystery-out-volcanic-gas-sampling)\nJune 17, 2025\n####  Taking the mystery out of volcanic gas sampling \nSeptember 24, 2021\n####  [ Multidisciplinary constraints on magma compressibility, the pre-eruptive exsolved volatile fraction, and the H2O/CO2 molar ratio for the 2006 Augustine eruption, Alaska  Multidisciplinary constraints on magma compressibility, the pre-eruptive exsolved volatile fraction, and the H2O/CO2 molar ratio for the 2006 Augustine eruption, Alaska ](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/multidisciplinary-constraints-magma-compressibility-pre-eruptive-exsolved-volatile)\nGeodetically modeled reservoir volume changes during volcanic eruptions are commonly much smaller than the observed eruptive volumes.

And, also to provide applied research for local, state, and federal agencies, and private industry, when research needs are within the scope of the USGS mission.\nAs the primary Federal science agency for water-resources information, the USGS is responsible for monitoring the quantity and quality of water in the Nation's rivers and aquifers and assessing the sources and fate of contaminants in aquatic systems. Towards this goal, a top priority for the USGS is to provide information to better define and manage the quality of the Nation's water resources. The CACL directly addresses this priority issue for the USGS by improving strategies to identify and protect drinking-water sources. The approach of the CACL is focused on the integration of the various disciplines that include core examination, sequence stratigraphy, borehole geophysics, digital optical borehole imaging, seismic, ground-penetrating radar, and 3D geomodeling.\n### Our Mission\nThe mission of the Carbonate Aquifer Characterization Laboratory (CACL) is to develop methods for carbonate aquifer characterization and conduct applied research that focuses on better understanding groundwater flow in multi-porosity carbonate aquifers. Groundwater flow in carbonate aquifers is particularly difficult to characterize because of a broad range in pore size and complicated pore connectivity. Diverse porosity and permeability networks represent a significant challenge to the accurate simulation of carbonate aquifer groundwater flow. This research is integrating the use of state-of-the-art technologies, including:\n  * Study of outcrop and subsurface carbonate rocks\n  * Cyclostratigraphy\n  * Ichnology\n  * High-multichannel 2D and 3D seismic\n  * Advanced borehole geophysics\n  * Digital optical borehole imagingComputational methods (eg., Lattice Boltzmann methods)\n  * 3D geomodeling with ROXAR RMS™\n  * Ground-penetrating radar\n\n\n[ Media ](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/rock-core-12-sample-carbonate-aquifer-characterization-lab)\nSources/Usage: Public Domain.

Mountain, Xavier Comas, Kevin J. Cunningham\nBy\n[Caribbean-Florida Water Science Center (CFWSC)](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/cfwsc)\nOverview \nThe Carbonate Aquifer Characterization Laboratory (CACL) was initiated to promote collaborative research on carbonate aquifer characterization between the USGS and other governmental scientific agencies and academia. And, also to provide applied research for local, state, and federal agencies, and private industry, when research needs are within the scope of the USGS mission.\nAs the primary Federal science agency for water-resources information, the USGS is responsible for monitoring the quantity and quality of water in the Nation's rivers and aquifers and assessing the sources and fate of contaminants in aquatic systems. Towards this goal, a top priority for the USGS is to provide information to better define and manage the quality of the Nation's water resources. The CACL directly addresses this priority issue for the USGS by improving strategies to identify and protect drinking-water sources. The approach of the CACL is focused on the integration of the various disciplines that include core examination, sequence stratigraphy, borehole geophysics, digital optical borehole imaging, seismic, ground-penetrating radar, and 3D geomodeling.\n### Our Mission\nThe mission of the Carbonate Aquifer Characterization Laboratory (CACL) is to develop methods for carbonate aquifer characterization and conduct applied research that focuses on better understanding groundwater flow in multi-porosity carbonate aquifers. Groundwater flow in carbonate aquifers is particularly difficult to characterize because of a broad range in pore size and complicated pore connectivity. Diverse porosity and permeability networks represent a significant challenge to the accurate simulation of carbonate aquifer groundwater flow. This research is integrating the use of state-of-the-art technologies, including:\n  * Study of outcrop and subsurface carbonate rocks\n  * Cyclostratigraphy\n  * Ichnology\n  * High-multichannel 2D and 3D seismic\n  * Advanced borehole geophysics\n  * Digital optical borehole imagingComputational methods (eg., Lattice Boltzmann methods)\n  * 3D geomodeling with ROXAR RMS™\n  * Ground-penetrating radar\n\n\n[ Media ](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/rock-core-12-sample-carbonate-aquifer-characterization-lab)\nSources/Usage: Public Domain.

LOI is performed on volumetric wet samples in order to also obtain the bulk density of a sample.\n_Macrofossil analysis_ - Macrofossils are the remains of previously living plants that are large enough to be seen without the aid of a microscope. They can provide information about the types of plants living at the sampling location through time. As conditions changes, plant macrofossil assemblages change. We perform plant macrofossil analysis using semi-quantitative methods that includes sieving a uniform quantity of peat or sediment through a 250-µm sieve. All remaining material on the sieve is washed into a petri dish and examined under a dissecting or compound microscopes to aid in taxonomic identification of the macrofossils. Individual specimens (seeds, leaves, needles, charcoal) are tallied, while relative percentages of the dominant the organic matter type (herbaceous, ligneous, humified) are recorded. Where needed, macrofossils are picked and cleaned for radiocarbon (age dating of sediments and peat) analysis.\n**Chemical and geochemical preparation of samples:**\n  * Acid digestion – dissolves a sample in a dilution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) to remove any inorganic carbon present in the sample in preparation for elemental or isotope analysis.\n  * Elemental Analysis – a CE Thermoscientific FlashSmart elemental analyzer is used to determine the weight and percent composition of the elements carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen that are present in a sample.\n  * Cellulose extraction – isolates cellulose from plant macrofossils for the purpose of performing isotope analysis on the extracted cellulose. This process includes chemical and physical treatments requiring specialized equipment such as a centrifuge, chemical fume hood, and freeze-dryer.\n\n\n",

(Public domain.)\nCore collecting is often strenuous and time consuming, requiring a small team to perform the work successfully and in a timely manner. Our lab technicians and student interns often assist in the field to collect sediment core samples, using a variety of field gear and coring equipment, depending on the depositional environment and the type of information researchers after. Types of coring equipment we commonly use include Russian corers and vibracorers. Each core is measured, photographed and described in our field log for later reference. Finally, each core section is carefully wrapped to prevent contamination and for safe transportation to our lab.\n[ Media ](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/fbgc-pollen-lab-april-2017)\nSources/Usage: Public Domain.

This sample was collected from the Great Dismal Swamp, VA. (Credit: Diana Carriker. USGS. Public domain.)\n**_In the Lab_**\nOnce the cores are delivered to the lab, they are cataloged, cleaned, photographed, and cut into 1-cm intervals. These are then weighed, dried, and subsampled for pollen processing.\nPollen and spores, two types of palynomorphs, are very resilient and resistant to decay under anaerobic conditions. For this reason, field samples are treated with a variety of chemicals that include acids and bases, heating, and ultrasonic treatments. These treatments tend to release and concentrate a sample's palynomorphs in addition to removing the genetic material contained within each pollen grain. The samples are then sieved, swirled, stained and the resultant polynomorph residue is mounted onto slides. The slides are passed on to the scientists while any remaining residue is placed into glass vials and stored for future use.\n_Please note: we are not a fee-for-service laboratory, but we welcome new

We examine how factors such as natural and human disturbances, climate, succession, and soil fertility shape ecosystem biogeochemistry - and the reciprocal effect of biogeochemical cycles on these and other factors.\nWe are particularly interested in how activities within ecosystems shape nutrient inputs, losses, and whole-system nutrient balances, and in linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.\nOur studies occur primarily in Pacific Northwest forests, with a strong focus on cycles of carbon and major nutrients through soils, plants, water, and air. Nitrogen is especially important in this work - both as a control on local ecosystem structure and function - and as a broker between ecosystem properties and land management. Interest in the causes and consequences of nutrient limitation on land extends our studies into other regions and types of ecosystems, as well as into simulation modeling.

These stressors impact ecosystem productivity and pose costly risks to health, safety, and economic wellbeing in the vast rangelands, protected areas, and military installations of the Western United States. We partner with federal, state, tribal, and private land managers to identify the most cost-efficient and effective solutions to these threats, including monitoring and evaluating remedial treatment outcomes over millions of acres. Our science is also used to help inform more efficient regulations and show return on investments for management actions. \nOur team of plant-soil specialists has expertise and ongoing projects on soil stabilization and health, control of exotic invasive plants, restoration of desirable native perennials, rehabilitation of severely disturbed lands, design and assessment of fuels treatments, vegetation mapping and remote sensing techniques, wildfire risk modeling, monitoring and treatment evaluation, and optimizing livestock grazing. A unique feature of the FIREss team is their participation in management with the agencies we support, including all type of pre- and post-fire treatments and fire suppression (including red card certification for incident support). \nOur geographic focus is non-forested uplands, which is the most extensive land type in the western USA and in the US Departments of Interior and Defense. The science has been used to improve the efficiency of regulations and can empower regulatory reform. The return on investment is visible satellite imagery as greener and more productive rangelands and wildlife habitat. \nFIREss has provided many technical trainings and workshops, in addition to consultations to managers facing specific problems with wildfire, invasions, and rehabilitation. The resulting relationships have led to formation of a number of larger science-management partnerships, such as the USGS-DoD FIREss team. Much of the land-based training and testing needed by the Department of Defense occurs in remote shrub-steppe. USGS-DoD FIREss provides tactical monitoring, fire-risk assessments, and timely prescriptions for fuels treatments to moderate invasion of wildfire-promoting invasive plants and thereby enable continuity and efficiency of military operations. \n[Post-Fire Restoration](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/forest-and-rangeland-ecosystem-science-center/science/post-fire-restoration)\n## Post-Fire Restoration\n[Invasives](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/forest-and-rangeland-ecosystem-science-center/science/invasives)\n## Invasives\n### Meet the Team\n#### Principal Investigator\n[Matt Germino](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/matthew-j-germino): Supervisory Research Ecologist\n#### Technical theme leads \n[_Brynne Lazarus_](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/brynne-e-lazarus): Plant-Soil Scientist, Analytical Lab Manager, and Supervisory Support \nResearch, technique development, and extension on herbicide and bioherbicide applications, restoration and rehabilitation, and local-scale experimentation \n[_Cara Applestein_](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/cara-v-applestein): Large-Landscape Data Integration Scientist \nAnalytical technique development and application for large and complex datasets, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, national-scale evaluation of effectiveness of post-fire management, analyses to make satellite data suited for vegetation mapping, digital tools to increase cost-efficiency and reliability of landscape monitoring and evaluation. \n[_Bill Davidson_](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/bill-e-davidson): Plant, Seed, and Soil Rehabilitation Specialist \nPost-fire grazing management; micrometeorological instrumentation, root-soil microbial interactions, development and testing of materials for native plant restoration.

These stressors impact ecosystem productivity and pose costly risks to health, safety, and economic wellbeing in the vast rangelands, protected areas, and military installations of the Western United States. We partner with federal, state, tribal, and private land managers to identify the most cost-efficient and effective solutions to these threats, including monitoring and evaluating remedial treatment outcomes over millions of acres. Our science is also used to help inform more efficient regulations and show return on investments for management actions. \nOur team of plant-soil specialists has expertise and ongoing projects on soil stabilization and health, control of exotic invasive plants, restoration of desirable native perennials, rehabilitation of severely disturbed lands, design and assessment of fuels treatments, vegetation mapping and remote sensing techniques, wildfire risk modeling, monitoring and treatment evaluation, and optimizing livestock grazing. A unique feature of the FIREss team is their participation in management with the agencies we support, including all type of pre- and post-fire treatments and fire suppression (including red card certification for incident support). \nOur geographic focus is non-forested uplands, which is the most extensive land type in the western USA and in the US Departments of Interior and Defense. The science has been used to improve the efficiency of regulations and can empower regulatory reform. The return on investment is visible satellite imagery as greener and more productive rangelands and wildlife habitat. \nFIREss has provided many technical trainings and workshops, in addition to consultations to managers facing specific problems with wildfire, invasions, and rehabilitation. The resulting relationships have led to formation of a number of larger science-management partnerships, such as the USGS-DoD FIREss team. Much of the land-based training and testing needed by the Department of Defense occurs in remote shrub-steppe. USGS-DoD FIREss provides tactical monitoring, fire-risk assessments, and timely prescriptions for fuels treatments to moderate invasion of wildfire-promoting invasive plants and thereby enable continuity and efficiency of military operations. \n[Post-Fire Restoration](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/forest-and-rangeland-ecosystem-science-center/science/post-fire-restoration)\n## Post-Fire Restoration\n[Invasives](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/forest-and-rangeland-ecosystem-science-center/science/invasives)\n## Invasives\n### Meet the Team\n#### Principal Investigator\n[Matt Germino](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/matthew-j-germino): Supervisory Research Ecologist\n#### Technical theme leads \n[_Brynne Lazarus_](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/brynne-e-lazarus): Plant-Soil Scientist, Analytical Lab Manager, and Supervisory Support \nResearch, technique development, and extension on herbicide and bioherbicide applications, restoration and rehabilitation, and local-scale experimentation \n[_Cara Applestein_](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/cara-v-applestein): Large-Landscape Data Integration Scientist \nAnalytical technique development and application for large and complex datasets, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, national-scale evaluation of effectiveness of post-fire management, analyses to make satellite data suited for vegetation mapping, digital tools to increase cost-efficiency and reliability of landscape monitoring and evaluation. \n[_Bill Davidson_](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/bill-e-davidson): Plant, Seed, and Soil Rehabilitation Specialist \nPost-fire grazing management; micrometeorological instrumentation, root-soil microbial interactions, development and testing of materials for native plant restoration.

Since 2021, the USGS Youth and Education in Science Office has hosted Einstein Fellows. Here are their projects. \n## About Our Fellows\n**2022-23: Candyce Curry, Birmingham AL.** Candyce taught science in middle and high school, and prior to her fellowship year, she was working as a district STEM curriculum specialist with Birmingham City Schools. Candyce has a strong interest in education for all. At USGS, she began working with the DC Public Schools and the Federal Urban Waters Partnership to develop lessons for K-13 students on urban waters and environmental issues. She also helped us launch our USGS Data in Schools website, to help teachers integrate data into their science lessons. After the fellowship, she became an Alabama Science In Motion Specialist with the Alabama State Department of Education.\n**2021-22: Joel Truesdell, Hilo HI.** Joel came to us from Kamehameha Schools where he taught high school chemistry and coached runners. He helped us bring traditional Hawaiian mo’olelo (stories) into our teaching resources about Kilauea. He also developed a Native Youth in STEM program for Navajo and Hopi 8th graders in Arizona. After the fellowship, Joel retired from teaching and is now a consultant on culturally relevant teaching and indigenous knowledge in STEM. \n**2021-22: Sergio de Alba, Los Banos CA.** Sergio grew up in the farming community where he later became a teacher. Finding he was not reaching his 5th graders with the science lessons he planned, he asked them what they needed, and they said “build a garden.” So he did, and over the course of a few years he transformed science teaching in that school and for the community through multiple gardens and native trees. At USGS, Sergio worked for the Water Mission Area, and developed five units on water and human interactions. Follow the _our Water, Our Lives_ units linked below. \n**2020-21: Dr. Kama Almasi, Yachats OR.** Kama is a middle school math and STEM teacher from a small town on the central Oregon Coast. In the summer of 2021, wildfires burned in their county, threatening the community and destroying property, so Kama was interested in wildfire science. She also worked on a unit about water for upper elementary school students. After the fellowship, Kama did a second Einstein Fellowship year on Capitol Hill. In 2022, she began working for the State of Oregon on educational policy. \n## Projects\n[Wildland Fire – Kama Almasi](https://www.usgs.gov/educational-resources/wildland-fire-school)\n## Wildland Fire – Kama Almasi\n[Water World – Kama Almasi](https://www.usgs.gov/educational-resources/water-world)\n## Water World – Kama Almasi\n[Kilauea Hot Spot – Joel Truesdell](https://www.usgs.gov/educational-resources/exploring-hot-spot-volcanism-and-a-mysterious-lake-summit-kilauea-using)\n## Kilauea Hot Spot – Joel Truesdell\n[Our Water Our Lives – Sergio de Alba](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/our-water-our-lives-a-series-water-units-intermediate)\n## Our Water Our Lives – Sergio de Alba\n[Data in Schools – Candyce Curry](https://www.usgs.gov/educational-resources/usgs-data-schools)\n## Data in Schools – Candyce Curry\n",

They would encounter many challenges along the way, but also learn many things about this river basin that spans many western states. John Wesley Powell later became the second director of the USGS.\n1969: After years of hard work, great successes and terrible failures, U.S. astronauts landed on the Moon. Of course you know that NASA sent them, but did you know that USGS scientists helped to train them? No one knew what the surface of the Moon would be like, so USGS scientists taught the astronauts geology, and helped them learn to walk in space suits over uneven, rocky ground.\n2069: How old will you be in 2069, and where will scientists be exploring? Perhaps that year, or a little sooner, or a little later, NASA and the USGS will be celebrating our exploration of Mars, and maybe you will be a part of that. What will we find there? We know more than we knew about the Moon because we have been exploring Mars. One place John Wesley Powell would likely want to go is the Grand Canyon of Mars - Valles Marineris...\n",

The most important is to decide how the well will be used. If the well is for drinking water, then local geology, hydrology, and state regulations are important to know. Contact the department in your state government that regulates and tracks water and natural resources. They should have information on licensed drillers and any required groundwater withdrawal permits. They can also provide guidelines for required distances from septic or water treatment systems, well construction, water testing, and well purification and maintenance. \nStates also have databases of previously drilled wells that can be used to estimate required well depth and possible pumping rates. For information on local geology or hydrology, contact your [USGS Water Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/science/science-centers), which can also help you find the appropriate state agency.\nLearn more:\n  * [Ground Water and the Rural Homeowner](https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/gw_ruralhomeowner/)\n\n\n## Related\n\n\n####  [ What determines if a well will go dry?

The 40Ar/39Ar isotopic system allows for age determination of potassium-bearing phases over ~104-109 yr timescales, spanning most of geologic time. Thus, 40Ar/39Ar geochronology is an indispensable tool in documenting rock histories in support of USGS mission critical goals in geologic mapping, geologic hazards, energy, and minerals research. The BARD Lab utilizes a tailored approach, including optical and electron petrography, geochemical modeling, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and other methods to understand the petrologic context of dated minerals. This work is commonly done in close collaboration with USGS geologic field mappers and in direct support of USGS-National Cooperative Geologic Mapping (NCGMP) projects.**\n### Research and Expertise\nLab staff conduct research that places time constraints on geologic units and processes. A major component of our work focuses on poly-deformed igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Appalachian Mountains, but we also work globally. Most of this geochronologic research emphasizes detailed sample characterization as a key to understanding the geologic implications of radiogenic isotope measurements. We apply our expertise in mineralogy, microtexture, and metamorphic petrology, along with a variety of tools (see associated facilities), to assess isotopic data collected in the BARD Lab and other laboratories.\nLab staff also conduct research on active tectonics, landscape evolution, and tectonic geomorphology. We apply our expertise in detrital geochronology by the 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb methods, low temperature thermochronology by the 40Ar/39Ar and U-Th/He methods, and more recently cosmogenic nuclide dating.

[View Media Details](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/sediment-core-x-ray-ct-system-santa-cruz)\nThe Geotek RXCT, a rotating x-ray computed tomography system, is used for creating ultra high-resolution imagery of sediment cores. The system resides at the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California. It requires the operator to take specialized training and hold safety certifications.\nThe Geotek RXCT, a \"rotating x-ray computed tomography\" system, creates ultra high-resolution imagery of sediment cores. The system resides at the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California. It requires the operator to take specialized training and hold X-ray radiation and safety certifications.\nIn medicine, radiologists use computed tomography (CT) scans to collect highly detailed images of your body. Similarly, the RXCT creates a complete 3-D image rendering of a sediment core by combining a series of X-ray images taken from different angles around it (thus, the \"rotating\" part of the name). The system then uses computer processing to create cross-sectional images (slices) of the core. Thus, a CT scan provides more detailed information than a simple 2-D X-ray image.\nThe images created by the RXCT allow scientists to look into the core at any area and at any angle, without having to carve into it. Looking at the structure and composition of cores in this fashion helps scientists determine the history of the location where the core was collected, such as the seafloor, a lake bed, or a marshy area. For example, if they find a sandy layer in an otherwise calm environment, like a coastal marsh which is normally just peat and mud, this may be evidence of a big wave event that carried sand from the beach and nearshore back into the marsh area. Further inspection of the CT image may reveal subtle sedimentary characteristics of the sandy deposit such as changes in grainsize, heavy mineral layers, and rip-up clasts that may help researchers determine whether deposition occurred during a tsunami or a storm.\n[ Media ](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/sediment-core-a-lake-mud-and-sand)\nSources/Usage: Public Domain.

The box shows the area of an expanded, zoomed-in section of these images, which is displayed in the center. In both the CT scan and the photograph, the lighter, brighter colors are dense sand and the darker colors are mud layers. At far right is another false color image of the CT scan.

[View Media Details](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/sediment-core-a-lake)\nFalse color CT scan of a core from Floras Lake, a coastal lake in southern Oregon that contains a record of tsunamis going back at least 6700 years. The beige (light) color is sand, which is more dense than the mud (brown, dark) surrounding it. As the animation continues, the darker colors are hidden in order to highlight the lighter colors of the sand deposits. This helps scientists see amazing detail to help them form the sedimentologic \"story\" about how the sand was deposited. The oval fragments of mud in the upper part of the sandy deposit appear to be rip-up clasts, indicative of an erosive, high flow into the lake that deposited beach and dune sand in the basin. This particular deposit is about 8 cm thick, and radiocarbon dating of sediments above and below the sand suggest that the tsunami was generated by a Cascadia megathrust earthquake roughly 2000 years ago.\n[ Media ](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/rov-dives-ca-and-or-and-sediment-core-images)\nSources/Usage: Public Domain.

The ROV is operated by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) from the research vessel (R/V) _Western Flyer_. The USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz regularly collaborates with MBARI, and most recently the USGS and MBARI efforts center around the study of the Cascadian Margin, a subduction zone off CA, OR, and WA. The figure includes a photograph of a vertical slice through the upper 80 cm of the core \"DR1281 VC-870,\" with a zoomed in section to the right, outlined in red. Lighter colors indicate sandy sediment and suggest horizons associated with 4 turbidites. In the lower right is a perpendicular slice through a horizon (its location is marked as an orange line through the zoomed-in cross-section) showing coarse grains that are characteristic of turbidites. Previously published work identified a sand layer in a core at this same site and subbottom depth, which was determined to be associated with the January 1700 Cascadia mega-earthquake and subsequent tsunami.\n[ New Video Offers Virtual Tour of the USGS Sediment Core Lab ](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/news/new-video-offers-virtual-tour-usgs-sediment-core-lab)\nFebruary 15, 2024\n####  New Video Offers Virtual Tour of the USGS Sediment Core Lab \n[ Searching for Evidence of Past Tsunamis in Sediment Cores ](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/news/searching-evidence-past-tsunamis-sediment-cores)\nNovember 23, 2021\n####  Searching for Evidence of Past Tsunamis in Sediment Cores \n[ New evidence for a roughly 600-year-old tsunami impacting the Hawaiian Islands ](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/news/new-evidence-roughly-600-year-old-tsunami-impacting-hawaiian-islands)\nMay 3, 2019\n####  New evidence for a roughly 600-year-old tsunami impacting the Hawaiian Islands \nAugust 26, 2021\n####  [ Rebounds, regresses, and recovery: A 15-year study of the coral reef community at Pila‘a, Kaua‘i after decades of natural and anthropogenic stress events  Rebounds, regresses, and recovery: A 15-year study of the coral reef community at Pila‘a, Kaua‘i after decades of natural and anthropogenic stress events ](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/rebounds-regresses-and-recovery-a-15-year-study-coral-reef-community-pilaa-kauai-after)\nPila‘a reef on the north shore of Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i was subjected to a major flood event in 2001 that deposited extensive sediment on the reef flat, resulting in high coral mortality.

Liquid samples include seawater containing dissolved compounds or gases and pore waters extracted from sediments near gas seeps or gas hydrate deposits. Gaseous samples are often extracted from void space in recovered sediment cores or from headspace above liquid samples. Solid phase analyses focus on sediment organic matter, authigenic carbonates and certain other minerals that can be indicators for methane dynamics in marine systems (e.g., pyrite, barite). Gas Hydrates Project biogeochemistry researchers have a strong focus on carbon cycling, greenhouse and hydrocarbon gases, and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon and particulate organic carbon in the marine environment. \nMany of the Project’s analyses are conducted with standard laboratory equipment, such as a UIC coulometer, a Dionex ion chromatograph with autosampler, a single wavelength Thermo spectrophotometer, and SRI gas chromatograph (GC). When analyses cannot be completed at the USGS, the Gas Hydrates Project collaborates with researchers at other institutions, especially the National Oceanographic Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (NOSAMS) facility, Oregon State University, University of Alaska-Fairbanks, University of New Hampshire, California Institute of Technology, and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. \nMicrobiological analyses complement geochemical measurements by providing insight on the presence and activity of microbes involved in methane production and oxidation. Therefore, USGS gas hydrates scientists also collaborate with other researchers on lipid biomarker, metagenomic, and microbial function analyses to identify the role of microbes in paleo- and contemporary methane systems, particularly in marine, lacustrine and estuarine settings. \nSedecimpus Thumbs Up!\nMichael Casso (USGS) and Alex Frank (WHOI) celebrate the first successful trial of the Sedecimpus incubation system.\n[View and Download](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/sedecimpus-thumbs)\n×\n1 / 4\nShow captions\nShowing image 1 of 4\nSources/Usage: Public Domain.

The lab specializes in radiogenic isotope studies that contribute to projects nationwide and internationally in collaboration with scientists from GECSC, G3SC and other USGS Science Centers, as well as with colleagues from other Federal Agencies and academic institutions.\nRadiogenic isotopes are nuclides derived from natural radioactive decay in the environment. They are useful for determining radiometric ages of rocks, minerals, and soils, and can be used as natural tracers of geologic, hydrologic, and biologic processes. DRIL scientists are currently focused on radiometric dating by U-Pb and U-Th, as well as tracer studies using natural isotopes of U (234U/238U), Pb (204Pb-206Pb-207Pb-208Pb), Sr (87Sr/86Sr), and Nd (143Nd/144Nd); however, collaborative investigations of other isotope systems are possible.
